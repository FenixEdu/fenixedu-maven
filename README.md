DSI Releaser v0.1
=========

DSI Releaser is a script created to automate the process of releasing any Maven project, using Maven's [release plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/), while following the conventions of [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Note that the script does NOT push anything into the upstream repositories, giving the user a chance to confirm that the release went as expected.

## Usage

To use DSI Releaser simply put `dsi-releaser.sh` in a folder in your `PATH`, and invoke the script.

## Example

```sh
jpc@arthas ~/workspace/bennu (release/1.2.0) $ dsi-releaser.sh

```


## Requirements


In order for the release to be successful, there are some requirements:

 1. You must have the release branch checked out, with the correct version number (i.e. release/1.2.3 to release version 1.2.3)
 * You must be in the top-level folder, where the aggregator POM is (or the project's POM if it is a single-module repository)
 * You must have the working directory clean (i.e. no uncommitted changes)
 * The tag for the release must not exist
 * Your `master/develop` branches must be up-to-date with your upstream remote, otherwise you WILL get conflicts and your branches will diverge
 * Your POMs must be in a `SNAPSHOT` version

## Features

 * Performing several sanity checks, to ensure the environment fulfills the requirements (not all requirements are enforced in the current version).
 * Invoking `maven-release-plugin`
 * Merging into the `master/develop` branches
 * Creating the SNAPSHOT-bump commit in `develop`
 * Creating the release tag from the `master` branch
 * Deleting the release branch
 * Deploying the released version to Nexus
  
## Future Development

 * Correctly abort the release if there is a compilation error in Maven
 * Check that the local `master/develop` branches are up-to-date
